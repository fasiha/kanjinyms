# Kanjinyms

This is a list of kanji, primitives, radicals, and even smaller units of Sinic characters with a set of English keywords intended to trigger the character.

Currently accompanies my [toponyms](https://github.com/fasiha//toponyms-and-nymes) database.

The hierarchy isn’t important, just helpful for organizational purposes.

There should be a one-to-one and *only* one-to-one relationship between kanji and English keywords.

Sometimes I use an English keyword as kanji to indicate a primitive that doesn’t exist in Unicode (or isn’t commonly supported by fonts). These follow [KanjiBreak](https://kanji.aldebrn.me/export.html#primitives).
